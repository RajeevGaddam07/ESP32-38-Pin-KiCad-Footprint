# ESP32 38-Pin KiCad Footprint and Symbol

Welcome to the ESP32 38-Pin KiCad Footprint and Symbol repository! This project provides a comprehensive footprint and schematic symbol for the ESP32 module with a 38-pin layout. It is designed to simplify your PCB design workflow when working with ESP32-based projects.

## Features

- **Accurate Footprint:** Detailed KiCad footprint for the 38-pin ESP32 module.
- **Custom Schematic Symbol:** Easy-to-use symbol for schematic capture.
- **Ready-to-Use:** Suitable for various projects including IoT applications and embedded systems.
- **Open Source:** Contributions and modifications are welcome!

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the ESP32 footprint and symbol into your KiCad project.

### Prerequisites

- [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) (version 6 or higher recommended)
- Basic knowledge of KiCad schematic capture and PCB layout design

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RajeevGaddam07/ESP32-38-Pin-KiCad-Footprint.git
   ```

2. **Add Footprint to KiCad Library:**

   - Copy the footprint file (`ESP32-38-Pin.pretty`) to your KiCad footprint library directory.
   - Alternatively, add the repository as a custom library in the KiCad Preferences.

3. **Add Symbol to KiCad Library:**

   - Copy the symbol file (if provided in the repository) to your KiCad symbol library directory.
   - Alternatively, integrate it as a custom symbol library.

## Usage

- **Schematic Capture:** Place the ESP32 symbol into your schematic and associate it with the corresponding footprint.
- **PCB Layout:** Utilize the footprint in your PCB design. The footprint is designed with precise pad dimensions and spacing to match the ESP32 38-pin layout.
- **Customization:** Feel free to modify the footprint or symbol to suit your project needs.
